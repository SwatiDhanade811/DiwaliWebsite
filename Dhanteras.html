            Dhanteras, derived from Dhan meaning wealth and teras meaning thirteenth, marks the thirteenth day of the dark 
            fortnight of Kartik and the beginning of Diwali.[113] On this day, many Hindus clean their homes and business 
            premises. They install diyas, small earthen oil-filled lamps that they light up for the next five days, near 
            Lakshmi and Ganesha iconography.[113][105] Women and children decorate doorways within homes and offices with 
            rangolis, colourful designs made from rice flour, flower petals, colored rice or colored sand,[111] while the 
            boys and men decorate the roofs and walls of family homes, markets, and temples and string up lights and lanterns.
             The day also marks a major shopping day to purchase new utensils, home equipment, jewellery, firecrackers, and other
              items.[105][40][81] On the evening of Dhanteras, families offer prayers (puja) to Lakshmi and Ganesha, and lay offerings
               of puffed rice, candy toys, rice cakes and batashas (hollow sugar cakes).[105]
            According to Tracy Pintchman, Dhanteras is a symbol of annual renewal, cleansing and an auspicious beginning for the next
             year.[113] The term "Dhan" for this day also alludes to the Ayurvedic icon Dhanvantari, the god of health and healing,
              who is believed to have emerged from the "churning of cosmic ocean" on the same day as Lakshmi.[113] Some communities,
               particularly those active in Ayurvedic and health-related professions, pray or perform havan rituals to Dhanvantari on  Dhanteras.[113]
            On Yama Deepam (also known as Yama Dipadana or Jam ke Diya), Hindus lights a diya, ideally made of wheat flour and filled 
            with sesame oil, that faces south in the back of their homes. This is believed to please Yama (Yamraj), the god of death, 
            and to ward off untimely death.[114] Some Hindus observe Yama Deepa on the second night before the main day of Diwali.[115][116]
