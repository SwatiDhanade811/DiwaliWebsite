        <p>
            The last day of the festival is called Bhai Duj (literally "brother's
             day"[146]), Bhau Beej, Bhai Tilak or Bhai Phonta. It celebrates the 
             sister-brother bond, similar in spirit to Raksha Bandhan but it is 
             the brother that travels to meet the sister and her family. This festive day 
             is interpreted by some to symbolise Yama's sister Yamuna welcoming Yama with a 
             tilaka, while others interpret it as the arrival of Krishna at his sister's,
              Subhadra, place after defeating Narakasura. Subhadra welcomes him with a tilaka 
              on his forehead.[143][147]The day celebrates the sibling bond between brother and 
              sister.[148] On this day the womenfolk of the family gather, perform a puja with
              prayers for the well being of their brothers, then return to a ritual of feeding their 
              brothers with their hands and receiving gifts. According to Pintchman, in some Hindu  
              traditions the women recite tales where sisters protect their brothers from enemies that
               seek to cause him either bodily or spiritual harm.[147] In historic times, this was a day
                in autumn when brothers would travel to meet their sisters, or invite their sister's family
                 to their village to celebrate their sister-brother bond with the bounty of seasonal harvests.[40]
            The artisan Hindu and Sikh community celebrates the fourth day as the Vishwakarma puja day.[note 13]
             Vishwakarma is the presiding Hindu deity for those in architecture, building, manufacturing, textile
              work and crafts trades.[23] [note 14] The looms, tools of trade, machines and workplaces are cleaned 
              and prayers offered to these livelihood means.[151]
