    <h3>
        <p>
            Naraka Chaturdashi also known as Chhoti Diwali, is the second day of festivities coinciding with the fourteenth day of
             the second fortnight of the lunar month.[117] The term "chhoti" means little, while "Naraka" means hell and "Chaturdashi"
              means "fourteenth".[118] The day and its rituals are interpreted as ways to liberate any souls from their suffering in 
              "Naraka", or hell, as well as a reminder of spiritual auspiciousness. For some Hindus, it is a day to pray for the peace 
              to the manes, or defiled souls of one's ancestors and light their way for their journeys in the cyclic afterlife.[119] A 
              mythological interpretation of this festive day is the destruction of the asura (demon) Narakasura by Krishna, a victory
              that frees 16,000 imprisoned princesses kidnapped by Narakasura.[118] It is also celebrated as Roop Chaudas in some North
               Indian households, where women bathe before sunrise, while lighting a Diya (lamp) in the bath area, they believe it helps
               eir beauty - it is a fun ritual that young girls enjoy as part of festivities. Ubtan is applied by the women which is made up of 
               special gram flour mixed with herbs for cleansing and beautifying themselves.
