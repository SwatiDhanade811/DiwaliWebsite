    <h3>
        <p>
            The day after Diwali is the first day of the bright fortnight of the luni-solar calendar.[140] It is regionally 
            called Annakut (heap of grain), Padwa, Goverdhan puja, Bali Pratipada, Bali Padyami, Kartik Shukla Pratipada and 
            other names.[111][140] According to one tradition, the day is associated with the story of Bali's defeat at the hands
             of Vishnu.[141][142] In another interpretation, it is thought to reference the legend of Parvati and her husband Shiva 
             playing a game of dyuta (dice) on a board of twelve squares and thirty pieces, Parvati wins. Shiva surrenders his shirt
              and adornments to her, rendering him naked.[140] According to Handelman and Shulman, as quoted by Pintchman, this legend 
              is a Hindu metaphor for the cosmic process for creation and dissolution of the world through the masculine destructive 
              power, as represented by Shiva, and the feminine procreative power, represented by Parvati, where twelve reflects the 
              number of months in the cyclic year, while thirty are the number of days in its lunisolar month.[140]
