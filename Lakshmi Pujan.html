    <h2>Lakshmi Pujan, Kali Puja (Day 3)<br>
        Main articles: Lakshmi Pujan and Kali Puja</h2>

        <p>
            The third day is the height of the festival,[125] and coincides with the last day of the dark fortnight of the lunar month.
             This is the day when Hindu, Jain and Sikh temples and homes are aglow with lights, thereby making it the "festival of 
             lights". The word Deepawali comes from the word the Sanskrit word deep, which means an Indian lantern/lamp.[47][126]
            The youngest members in the family visit their elders, such as grandparents and other senior members of the community, 
            on this day. Small business owners give gifts or special bonus payments to their employees between Dhanteras and Lakshmi 
            Pujan.[120][127] Shops either do not open or close early on this day allowing employees to enjoy family time. Shopkeepers
             and small operations perform puja rituals in their office premises. Unlike some other festivals, the Hindu typically do
              not fast during the five-day long Diwali including Lakshmi Pujan, rather they feast and share the bounties of the season 
              at their workplaces, community centres, temples and homes.[120]
